This was my course project for the course "Human Computer Interaction" at NITK. 
It was implemented using the Flask framework and is meant to have an easy-to-understand and simplistic UI. It was designed for toddlers, especially those with learning disabilities such as ADHD
The project was a joint effort with Aryan and Rishubh
